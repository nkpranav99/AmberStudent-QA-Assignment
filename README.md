# AmberStudent-QA-Assignment

The Assessment has been implemented by using **Python** and **Selenium**. The automation framework used here is the "**Gauge automation framework**."

The link to the official docs for the framework: https://docs.gauge.org/overview?os=windows&language=python&ide=vscode

The tests are stored in the specs folder with the file name - **qa_assessment.spec**.

When the local environment gets loaded, VS Code enables options to trigger either individual scenarios (i.e. the tests mentioned in the problem statement) or the entire specification file (this will run the entire file).
